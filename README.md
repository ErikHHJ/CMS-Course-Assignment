This site is a submission for a task where i was to make a website for a shop-website selling jackets. 

## Description
- The target audience was outdoorsy adults. The task provided mainly images, along with specified requirements for a contact page, about page, products page and specific page. 
- Initially it was made with HTML and CSS, but it has gone through changes from subsequent tasks in later subjects which included adding the products to a headless CMS with wordpress, and design improvements  with user testing. 
- The purpose of the website is to quickly find a jacket that suits your needs and designing a checkout process without actually paying for or recieving anything. It is just for show. 
- The design is made to mimic a typical outdoors apparell shop, which is why there are many images of nature, camping or hiking.
